<h1 align="center"/>CSSKit</h1>


<p>
    CSSKit is a small (less than 4kb) CSS framework that follows the iOS and human interface guidelines and colors, it
    automatically switches to dark/light mode based on the device appearance settings.
  </p>

  <p>
    This framework doesn't use classes, this means that you just have to use semantic HTML and the elements will
    automatically be styled for you!
  </p>

  <p>
    CSSKit comes bundled with 2 fonts, <code>Inter</code> and <code>Fira Code</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that this project is still being worked on and is nowhere near finished. Don't use this in production as
    things are expected to
    break.
  </p>

  <h2>How to use</h2>
  <p>
    Usage is really simple, all you have to do is include this line in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your HTML
    document.
